New in Version 0.34:
- The constructed "From " line now assumes EDT instead of the machine's
  timezone. This makes the test cases pass in timezones other than EDT.
- Generalized search for start of new email to a NULL character followed by
  three or more word characters or hyphens, followed by a colon. This improves
  dbx processing quite a bit.
- Fixed a potential infinite loop in mailbox reading.

New in Version 0.33:
- Restructured code.
- The date on the "From" line is now correctly built from the "From:" line.
  (Thanks to Maik Nijhuis <mnijhuis@multiweb.nl> for finding the bug.)
- mbx2mbox now uses Date::Manip to construct the date for the "From" line.
- Added tests
- Project moved to SourceForge (http://mbx2mbox@sourceforge.net/).

New in version 0.32:
- Improved parsing of emails (David Hall <davidahall@compuserve.com>)
- Header "From someone@somewhere.com" now uses sender's email address.
  (David Hall <davidahall@compuserve.com>)
- Quoted headers are no longer mistakenly processed.
  (David Hall <davidahall@compuserve.com>)

New in version 0.31:
- Linefeeds cleaned up. (By Twinkles <twinkles@one.net.au>)

New in version 0.3:
- Improved parsing of emails at the expense of speed for mailboxes with large
  attachments.

  (Weakened default removal for more friendly handling of non-English
  characters.) Thanks to Joerg Hau <joerg.hau@dplanet.ch>
- Added debugging mode (-d)
