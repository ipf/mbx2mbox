mbx2mbox - convert mbx and dbx mailboxes to standard RFC822 mailboxes

mbx2mbox attempts to convert Microsoft's proprietary .mbx and .dbx format
mailboxes to the standard RFC822 mailboxes used by programs like Pine, Eudora,
and Netscape. It does not work for newer versions of Outlook and Outlook
Express.

New in Version 0.34:
- The constructed "From " line now assumes EDT instead of the machine's
  timezone. This makes the test cases pass in timezones other than EDT.
- Generalized search for start of new email to a NULL character followed by
  three or more word characters or hyphens, followed by a colon. This improves
  dbx processing quite a bit.
- Fixed a potential infinite loop in mailbox reading.

New in Version 0.33:
- Restructured code.
- The date on the "From" line is now correctly built from the "From:" line.
  (Thanks to Maik Nijhuis <mnijhuis@multiweb.nl> for finding the bug.)
- mbx2mbox now uses Date::Manip to construct the date for the "From" line.
- Added tests
- Project moved to SourceForge (http://mbx2mbox@sourceforge.net/).
